While we have open‑sourced Hexagon‑MLIR to provide early access, we are not accepting external code contributions
or pull requests at this time. We warmly welcome issues, bug reports, and feature requests—your feedback will help shape priorities as we improve functionality,
performance, and robustness. We’ll revisit opening to external PRs once core APIs/IR stabilize and our CI/review processes are in place.
